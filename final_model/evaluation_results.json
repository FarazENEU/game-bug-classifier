It appears only under specific conditions \u2014 when the `std` feature is **disabled** for desktop builds on ARM. For web builds, as I can see, the time implementation differs and does not exhibit this issue. Still, this remains a bug.

Also, I've included some macros for nice syntax on top. I'm pretty proud of how nice I was able to make this, but there's still a bit of work to do, especially around generic code :) ## Testing - Ran examples - Tried to migrate existing `pipe` and `map` impls, but failed. This PR is pretty robust for most use cases but isn't fully ready for generic code yet. In particular, it's difficult to make sure the input types match (often have to wrap with `StaticSystemInput`) and `ReadOnlySystem` bound is inferred correctly when using for run conditions. These only really matter for combinators like `pipe` and `map\n\n### Output:\nSeverity: medium\nComponent: other\nReproducibility: sometimes"

It also slightly shrinks the textarea. ## Why? The short version is: Flexibility. Because it makes it easier to specify game styles without having to work around builtin limitations. The long version is: IMO builtin formspecs like the `/help` dialog should be stylable as much as possible and respect the game's `set_formspec_prepend` options. Hardcoding any color makes styling them harder as it restricts the amount of possible font colors or formspec colors you can use by default. Currently, this forces game authors to only use bright font colors for text areas, because dark font colors make the text"
