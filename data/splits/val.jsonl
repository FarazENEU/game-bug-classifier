This caused a panic for meshes where the vertices are all negative on any of the axes. And also means the aabb is incorrect, maybe causing issues like incorrect frustum culling? This PR adds a new constructor `Aabb::from_min_max`. `Mesh::take_gpu_data` now calls `from_min_max`, fixing the AABB calculation bug. ## Testing - I hit this bug with a model where all the vertices were negative in one dimension (so the max is all negative, and when it was wrongly passed as the half size, fails the assertion that half size is >= 0). Confirmed that this change fixes the issue. - This PR adds a unit test mimicking the above scenario, t", "output": "Severity: medium\nComponent: save\nReproducibility: sometimes\nSummary: Fix AABB in Mesh::take_gpu_data", "repository": "bevyengine/bevy", "original_state": "closed"}

Originally, I was going to make it so if the slide is broken down and set to unlimited rides per admission, guests would not want to ride it again and leave, but @ZehMatt commented that it would make more sense for them to not be able to slide down at all if it is broken. Currently, the Spiral Slide is the only ride where guests will still continue riding it like normal if it's broken, the only effect being that _new_ guests will not be allowed to enter the ride (through the pointy entrance hut), which is a weird inconsistency. @tupaschoal also commented there that forcing the slide to break down with the debug options enabled will not take effect immediately, but that ~~is a separate (old) bug", "output": "Severity: high\nComponent: gameplay\nReproducibility: rare\nSummary: Do not allow guests to slide down the Spiral Slide if it's broken", "repository": "OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2", "original_state": "closed"}

Particles are currently batched per material (see `src/client/particles.cpp`), in no particular order. Thus particles are not Z-sorted correctly relative to each other, whether they have the same material or not. This results in the classic semitransparency issue: You have two fragments, A and B, where B is semitransparent and in front of A. You draw B first, updating the Z-buffer.

The `MovingPtr` [here](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/8e4711cc40a883a1995dad06cc2b7e6f336b2f35/crates/bevy_ui_widgets/src/observe.rs#L51) is dropped when it goes out of scope, so the `assume_init` [here](https://github.com/bevyengine/bevy/blob/8e4711cc40a883a1995dad06cc2b7e6f336b2f35/crates/bevy_ui_widgets/src/observe.rs#L63) is invalid.

He has been able to do this since forever from what I remember, 5.13-dev included. It's harder to explain than to show it, so I'll share [a video](https://i.imgur.com/de7aokx.mp4) (ignore the weird situation, typical AES).
