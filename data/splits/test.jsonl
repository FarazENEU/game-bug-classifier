It introduces the syntax of `key1|key2`, with `key1` and `key2` being keysyms. On top of the first few commits, the event handler is changed to recheck whether an action should be \"pressed\" or not. (Note that the logic for _pressing_ the key is not short-circuited to set the action - this is helpful for a later PR to implement modifier keys.) - Does it resolve any reported issue?

{"instruction": "Classify this bug report and provide a structured analysis.", "input": "Title: [no squash] Use `int` for handling texture layer index in shader\n\nDescription: why so complicated? To use `int` we have to declare the variable `flat`, which is not available on old GLSL (hence the ifdef). Fortunately this doesn't conflict, because all versions that have array textures also have `flat`. Next the driver throws an error at us because you can't use `flat` with the deprecated `varying` (hence doing it only for GLES first). I thought this required migrating to GLSL 3.x, but actually `in`/`out` are already in GLSL 1.5. So that can be fixed. Finally, we can apply that to both GL3 and GLES2 as originally intended. Also we can change the vertex attribute to avoid another potentially problematic float conversion. This *should* fix the \"wrong texture rendered\" reports we've seen.

This issue has to do with park objects and/or asset packs ### Describe the issue When trying to create a bridge from an already elevated entrance/exit platform, the first tile is placed on or near the ground. It should be placed at the same height as the entrance/exit platform. ### Steps to reproduce Create a ride with an elevated entrance/exit on one of the beginner levels. (pre-built coaster as example, so it should be able to have a path here) Use the 'create bridge' tool to create a bridge from the elevated entrance/exit. ### Attachments <img width=\"2560\" height=\"1440\" alt=\"Image\" src=\"https://github.com/user-attachment", "output": "Severity: medium\nComponent: ui\nReproducibility: sometimes\nSummary: 'Construct bridge' starting piece at wrong height for elevated entrance", "repository": "OpenRCT2/OpenRCT2", "original_state": "open"}
